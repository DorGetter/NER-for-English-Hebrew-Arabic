## Abstract

In any text content, there are some terms that are more informative and unique in context. Named Entity Recognition (NER) also known as information extraction/chunking is the process in which algorithm extracts the real world noun entity from the text data and classifies them into predefined categories like person, place, time, organization, etc.

## BERT MODEL

In this project we are going to use pre-trained model Bert and use the tokenizer to interact with API UI.
