## Abstract

In any text content, there are some terms that are more informative and unique in context. Named Entity Recognition (NER) also known as information extraction/chunking is the process in which algorithm extracts the real world noun entity from the text data and classifies them into predefined categories like person, place, time, organization, etc.

## BERT MODEL

In our project we fine-tuned BERT models to perform named-entity 
recognition (NER) in three languages (English, Hebrew and Arabic).
The project provides web-based interface (written in REACT) that allows 
the user to enter text in one of the languages and get an output of the text
labeled into entities, and a table that shows for each word in the text what is 
the entity, and the confidence score.</b>
